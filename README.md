Java 3D Graph Visualisation Tool

Walrus is a tool for interactively visualizing large directed graphs in three-dimensional space. By employing a fisheye-like distortion, it provides a display that simultaneously shows local detail and the global context.

Walrus 0.7 has implemented the following enhancements into the tool

1.	Labeling/Un-Labeling feature for Graph nodes based on properties on selection and persistent rendering through graph rotation
2.	Configure lineage of graphs in the order of granularity
3.	Drill down feature to move view from parent graph to next granular level child graph
4.	Coloring of nodes based on range of values exhibited by property of a graph nodes
5.	Narrow down sub tree of graphs based on level of node displayable (Depth of visibility preceded by Actual depth)
6.	Search nodes of Graph and highlight-label based on matching user key against identified searchable property of a node
7.	Redundancy of view of redundant nodes in next granular level graph of a selected node in parent graph
